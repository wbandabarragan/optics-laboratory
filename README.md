# Optics Laboratory

## Universität Hamburg (2020-2021)

## Instructor:
Wladimir Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This course provides engineering students with an introduction to basic optics and lens systems. It describes lens laws and the experimental setups needed to construct some optical instruments used in science, such as microscopes and telescopes. The course explain the theory and shows the experimental setups with the assistance of the ray-optics applet from phydemo. This applet was very useful for teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Syllabus:

- Error Calculation and Propagation. Regression analysis.
- Optics, Lenses and Lens laws.
- Focal Length and Bessel Method (lens systems).
- Optical instruments (slide projector, microscope, telescope)

## Optics Design Applet: 

For some of the excercises we will use this applet:
