# Optics Laboratory

## Universität Hamburg (2020-2021)

## Instructor:
Wladimir Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This course provides an introduction to basic optics. It describes lens laws and the setup needed to construct some optical instruments, such as microscopes and telescopes. The course shows the experimental setups with the assistance of the ray-optics applet from phydemo. This applet was very useful for teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Syllabus:

- Error propagation
- Lens laws

## Optics Design Applet: 

For some of the excercises we will use this applet:
